Range Sum Calculator Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program calculates the sum of all numbers within a given range.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input two numbers (start and end of range)
- Uses a while loop to iterate through the range
- Calculates the sum of all numbers in the range
- Displays the sum

Features:

- User input for range
- Looping structure using while loop
- Calculation of sum using accumulator variable
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./range_sum
    - On Windows: range_sum.exe
4. Enter the start and end of the range when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using looping structures (while loop)
- Working with integer variables and arithmetic operators
- Basic accumulation and summation logic
